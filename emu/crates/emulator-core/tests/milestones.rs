//! Canary milestone regression tests.
//!
//! Each test runs the real BIOS for a fixed instruction count and
//! asserts that VRAM hashes to a known-good value. The hashes were
//! captured from a passing run and frozen as goldens — any code
//! change that alters what the BIOS draws at the same step count
//! breaks the test.
//!
//! These tests are `#[ignore]` by default because they take several
//! seconds each (500M instructions ≈ 11s in release). Run via:
//!
//! ```bash
//! cargo test -p emulator-core --release --test milestones -- --ignored
//! ```
//!
//! The hashes are FNV-1a-64 over the raw little-endian bytes of VRAM
//! (1024×512 × 2 bytes = 1 MiB). FNV-1a isn't cryptographic but
//! collisions by accident are vanishingly unlikely for our purpose
//! — any real regression will flip many VRAM bytes and produce a
//! completely different hash.
//!
//! Milestone ladder reference:
//! - A = BIOS boots to Sony logo (SCPH1001, no disc)
//! - B = BIOS boots to shell (MAIN MENU / MEMORY CARD / CD PLAYER)
//! - C = Homebrew SDK triangle renders (see `sdk/examples/hello-tri`)
//! - D = BIOS disc-check passes (a commercial title) — next rung
//!
//! When a new milestone passes for the first time, capture its hash
//! with:
//! ```bash
//! cargo run -p emulator-core --example vram_hash_at --release -- <steps>
//! ```
//! and paste the value here.
