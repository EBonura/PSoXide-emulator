//! Canary milestone regression tests.
//!
//! Each test runs the real BIOS for a fixed instruction count and
//! asserts that the result matches a known-good state. We check
//! three hashes per milestone to give us both correctness and
//! determinism coverage:
//!
//! 1. **Full-VRAM hash** (self-regression) — FNV-1a-64 over the
//!    1 MiB VRAM buffer. Catches any change in VRAM bytes, even
//!    off-screen CLUT/texture regions the user never sees. This
//!    pins our emulator to a bit-exact behavior run-to-run so any
//!    code change that alters rendering fails the test. **Does not
//!    validate against Redux** — if we're wrong in some consistent
//!    way, this test will still pass.
//!
//! 2. **Display-area hash** (self-regression) — FNV-1a-64 over the
//!    visible-display rectangle only (`GPU::display_hash`). Same
//!    caveat: self-consistent, not Redux-correct.
//!
//! 3. **Redux-verified display hash** (correctness) — where
//!    captured, the expected display-area hash that Redux produces
//!    at the same step count. If `redux_display_hash` is `Some(h)`
//!    and our `display_hash` doesn't equal it, the test fails and
//!    we know pixels diverged from reference. If `None`, we haven't
//!    captured Redux parity yet for that milestone.
//!
//! Capture a Redux-verified golden with:
//! ```bash
//! cargo run -p emulator-core --example display_parity_at --release -- <steps>
//! ```
//! which launches Redux, steps N instructions silently, reads its
//! screenshot, and diffs byte-for-byte against ours.
//!
//! Tests are `#[ignore]` by default because they take ~13s total
//! in release (the full-VRAM runs are fast; the Redux-parity step
//! is only triggered by `display_parity_at`, not by the unit test).
//! Run via:
//! ```bash
//! cargo test -p emulator-core --release --test milestones -- --ignored
//! ```
//!
//! Milestone ladder reference:
//! - A = BIOS boots to Sony logo (SCPH1001, no disc)
//! - B = BIOS boots to shell (MAIN MENU / MEMORY CARD / CD PLAYER)
//! - C = Homebrew SDK triangle renders (see `sdk/examples/hello-tri`)
//! - D = BIOS disc-check passes (a commercial title) — licensed-disc
//!       splash rendered; game boot-EXE load is still pending.
