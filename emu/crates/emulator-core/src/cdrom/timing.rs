/// Canonical cycle delays for command responses. The long-operation values
/// below retain their Redux provenance, while first-response acknowledgement
/// timing is calibrated from real controller measurements.
///
/// Redux cross-references (line numbers from the upstream file):
///
/// - `AddIrqQueue(CdlID + 0x100, 20480)` -- GetID second response,
///   ~4.4 µs, observed across boot roms (L900). `CdlInit` (`0x1C`)
///   uses the separate lid/rescan path instead of a second CDROM IRQ.
/// - `AddIrqQueue(CdlReset + 0x100, 4100000)` -- Reset (`0x0A`)
///   completion. a commercial title polls this INT2 before it starts issuing reads.
/// - `cdReadTime = psxClockSpeed / 75` -- one PSX CD-frame period
///   (L135). Redux schedules the first ReadN/ReadS sector at
///   `cdReadTime` in double-speed mode, then chains steady-state
///   sectors at `cdReadTime / 2` (single-speed uses 2x those delays).
/// - `scheduleCDPlayIRQ(SEEK_DONE ? 0x800 : cdReadTime * 4)` --
///   SeekL / SeekP second response (L875). If the target is already
///   seeked, quick ack; otherwise a full seek-time equivalent.
/// Typical command acknowledgement with no readable media. The CD controller
/// sub-CPU services commands from its firmware loop rather than responding in
/// the old fixed 0x800-cycle shortcut. Current hardware-oriented emulators use
/// roughly 15,000 cycles for the no-media path.
pub(super) const FIRST_RESPONSE_CYCLES: u64 = 15_000;

/// Typical acknowledgement with a disc present. The PAL PSone capture measured
/// GetStat at 30,286 cycles minimum including 257 cycles of MMIO/poll overhead,
/// yielding a 30,029-cycle controller delay. Its 48,590-cycle maximum confirms
/// the documented firmware-loop jitter; the floor is independently visible in
/// every command, while the maintenance-loop phase is modelled by the command
/// scheduler.

/// Unlike the rest of this module, this is NOT transcribed from Redux: it is a
/// PSoXide faithfulness model. On real hardware the CD sub-CPU is a single
/// controller; while it is streaming Red Book audio it services a new command
/// only after attending to the audio it is already decoding, so a command's
/// acknowledge is noticeably delayed. Emulators that ack every command in a
/// flat ~2048 cycles hide this, which is exactly why "poll the drive every
/// frame while music plays" looks free in emulation yet stalls (and, on a
/// missed/late poll, reseeks and kills the audio) on silicon.
///
/// Magnitude is derived from the audio-sector period ([`CD_READ_TIME`], a real
/// PSX spec) rather than a fabricated figure: a command lands within a fraction
/// of one CD frame. It is deliberately well under the cycles a generous polled
/// wait spins for (so intentional blocking handoffs like Pause-before-gameplay
/// still complete) and well over a cheap non-blocking poll's budget (so a
/// frame-rate status poll during playback correctly reads as "couldn't tell"
/// instead of stalling). Tune here if hardware measurement refines it.

/// Like [`CDDA_BUSY_RESPONSE_CYCLES`], a PSoXide faithfulness model rather
/// than a Redux transcription: Redux acks Play and declares the drive playing
/// at once, which makes every "has the track finished?" poll answer correctly
/// by accident. A real drive, and DuckStation, seek first, reporting SEEKING
/// with the playing bit CLEAR for the whole journey. Guest code that reads
/// "not playing" as "track over" therefore passes in emulation and restarts
/// its music on silicon.
///
/// Three regimes, after DuckStation's `GetTicksForSeek` (`src/core/cdrom.cpp`)
/// with its logarithmic terms linearised. The curve's exact shape matters far
/// less than its order of magnitude: what a guest can observe is that a
/// neighbouring track arrives within a frame or two while a cross-disc jump
/// takes most of a second, which is the difference that changes behaviour.
///
/// Deliberately free of DuckStation's per-seek jitter. That exists to shake
/// loose games that livelock on identical seek times; determinism is worth
/// more here, since the parity suites and every headless capture depend on it.
