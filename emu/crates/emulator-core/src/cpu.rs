//! MIPS R3000A CPU.
//!
//! Instruction set coverage grows one opcode at a time, each added
//! alongside a parity assertion against PCSX-Redux. The decoder itself
//! is intentionally a flat match on the primary opcode field -- we'll
//! refactor to a jump table only if a profiler says to.
//!
//! ## Provenance
//!
//! Portions of this module are parity-matched against, and in places
//! derived from, PCSX-Redux (<https://github.com/grumpycoders/pcsx-redux>),
//! Copyright (C) the PCSX-Redux authors, GPL-2.0-or-later. The MIPS
//! R3000A instruction set is standard; the inline `Redux` references mark
//! where edge-case and timing behaviour is matched to Redux. PSoXide is
