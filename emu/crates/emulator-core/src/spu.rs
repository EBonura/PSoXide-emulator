//! SPU — register-bank stub with voice tracking.
//!
//! This is **not** a real audio subsystem. No ADPCM decode, no
//! reverb, no output. What it *is*:
//!
//! - Full 512-byte MMIO register bank read/write, byte/halfword/
//!   word. Every addressable register stores what's written and
//!   reads it back — the only reason games would care about our
//!   accuracy at this layer is either "does the register bank
//!   echo correctly" or "does the voice-end bit (ENDX) flip on
//!   eventually".
//! - Per-voice ADSR-current-volume read (`+0xC`) pinned at `0x0001`
//!   to mirror Redux's reset state — the BIOS's SPU-init test
//!   checks this at ~step 19M.
//! - **Simulated ENDX** (voice-ended). Games like a commercial title start a
//!   set of voices on KON, then poll ENDX to know when a
//!   one-shot sample finishes. Without this, they wait forever.
//!   We track the cycle count at which each voice was key-on'd
//!   and set its ENDX bit once a heuristic "long enough for a
//!   typical sample" has passed. Not sample-accurate, but
//!   unblocks the "poll ENDX until non-zero" wait.
//!
//! The envelope / ADPCM / reverb / output work stays deferred
//! until actual audio matters.
