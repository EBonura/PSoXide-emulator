//! CD-ROM controller.
//!
//! **Full implementation**, not a stub -- the plan is to carry this
//! from BIOS-boot-without-disc (Milestone B) all the way through
//! real disc reads (Milestone D onward) and XA audio (Milestone F).
//! The file will grow by phase:
//!
//! - **6a (this file)**: register infrastructure -- the index-based
//!   MMIO dispatch, the three FIFOs (parameter, response, data),
//!   the IRQ flag/mask register model, the raw status byte.
//! - **6b**: command dispatcher with async-response scheduling.
//!   Commands queue first- and second-response events at specific
//!   cycle offsets; `tick` fires them when their time comes.
//! - **6c**: core commands that appear in every BIOS boot --
//!   Sync / GetStat / Init / Demute / GetID / Pause.
//! - **6d**: disc-present commands -- SetLoc, SeekL/SeekP, ReadN/ReadS,
//!   sector data streaming into the data FIFO + DMA channel 3.
//! - **6e**: ISO9660 filesystem hook from `psx-iso`.
//! - **6f**: audio plumbing -- volume matrix, XA decode (deferred
//!   to Milestone F when it actually matters).
//!
//! **Reference**: nocash PSX-SPX "CDROM Drive" and
//! `pcsx-redux/src/core/cdrom.cc`. Status-byte bits + IRQ types +
//! index semantics all follow those two.
//!
//! This module is parity-safe at the register level -- software that
//! reads status / queues parameters / pops responses sees the values
//! Redux would return. Command side effects (seeking, reading) start
//! landing in 6b onwards.
