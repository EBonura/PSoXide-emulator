//! Borrow-checked frame building over an ordering table.
//!
//! The GPU's linked-list DMA reads every packet of a frame after the CPU has
//! handed it over, so a packet must outlive the walk and must not change
//! during it. This module states that with lifetimes instead of `unsafe`:
//!
//! - [`OrderingTable::frame`] clears the table and borrows it as an
//!   [`OtFrame<'f, N>`] for `'f`.
//! - [`OtFrame::add`] takes each packet as `&'f mut P`, so the packet stays
//!   borrowed, and unmovable, for as long as the frame can be walked.
//! - [`OtFrame::submit`] and [`OtFrame::submit_with`] wait for the walk
//!   before they return, which is what lets `'f` end.
//! - [`PrimitiveArena`] splits caller storage into `&'f mut P` packets.
//! - For a walk that outlives the call that kicked it (CPU frame N+1 built
//!   while the GPU walks frame N), [`FrameStorage::draw_async`] needs the
//!   table and packet storage `&'static mut` and returns an [`InFlight`]
//!   that owns them, and the [`GpuDma`] token, until [`InFlight::wait`].
//!   Forgetting it leaks the storage rather than freeing it under the walk.
//!   [`FramePair`] runs the usual two-buffer ping-pong on top.
//!
//! Every type here is a thin wrapper over the same stores and kicks as
//! [`OtFrame::add_raw`] and [`crate::chain::submit_raw`].
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use psx_gpu::frame::{FramePair, FrameStorage, PrimitiveArena};
//! use psx_gpu::{ot::OrderingTable, prim::TriFlat};
//!
//! fn blocking(ot: &mut OrderingTable<8>, dma: &mut psx_io::periph::GpuDma) {
//!     let mut storage: [TriFlat; 4] =
//!         core::array::from_fn(|_| TriFlat::new([(0, 0); 3], 0, 0, 0));
//!     let mut frame = ot.frame();
//!     let mut arena = PrimitiveArena::new(&mut storage);
//!     if let Some(tri) = arena.push(TriFlat::new([(0, 0), (8, 0), (0, 8)], 255, 0, 0)) {
//!         frame.add(1, tri);
//!     }
//!     frame.submit(dma);
//!     // The walk is over: the table and the storage are free again.
//!     ot.clear();
//!     storage[0] = TriFlat::new([(0, 0); 3], 0, 0, 0);
//! }
//!
//! fn overlapped(
//!     storage: &'static mut FrameStorage<8, [TriFlat; 4]>,
//!     dma: psx_io::periph::GpuDma,
//! ) {
//!     let (in_flight, added) = storage.draw_async(dma, |frame, packets| {
//!         let mut arena = PrimitiveArena::new(packets);
//!         let tri = arena.push(TriFlat::new([(0, 0), (8, 0), (0, 8)], 0, 255, 0));
//!         tri.map(|tri| frame.add(1, tri)).is_some()
//!     });
//!     // ... CPU work while the GPU walks ...
//!     let (storage, dma) = in_flight.wait();
//!     let mut pair = FramePair::new(storage, other_storage(), dma);
//!     pair.present(|_frame, _packets| {});
//! #   let _ = added;
//! }
//! # fn other_storage() -> &'static mut FrameStorage<8, [TriFlat; 4]> { unimplemented!() }
//! ```
//!
//! # What the borrow checker rejects
//!
//! A packet that dies before the frame is submitted:
//!
//! ```compile_fail,E0597
//! # use psx_gpu::{ot::OrderingTable, prim::TriFlat};
//! # fn f(dma: &mut psx_io::periph::GpuDma) {
//! let mut ot = OrderingTable::<8>::new();
//! let mut frame = ot.frame();
//! {
//!     let mut tri = TriFlat::new([(0, 0), (8, 0), (0, 8)], 255, 0, 0);
//!     frame.add(1, &mut tri);
//! } // `tri` dropped here while the frame still links it
//! frame.submit(dma);
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! Clearing (or otherwise touching) the table while its walk is in flight:
//!
//! ```compile_fail,E0499
//! # use psx_gpu::ot::OrderingTable;
//! # fn f(dma: &mut psx_io::periph::GpuDma) {
//! let mut ot = OrderingTable::<8>::new();
//! let frame = ot.frame();
//! frame.submit_with(dma, || ot.clear());
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! Reusing the storage of an asynchronously kicked frame before waiting:
//!
//! ```compile_fail,E0499
//! # use psx_gpu::{frame::FrameStorage, prim::TriFlat};
//! # fn f(storage: &'static mut FrameStorage<8, [TriFlat; 4]>, dma: psx_io::periph::GpuDma) {
//! let (in_flight, ()) = storage.draw_async(dma, |_frame, _packets| {});
//! storage.draw_async(unsafe { psx_io::periph::GpuDma::steal() }, |_frame, _packets| {});
//! in_flight.wait();
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! Restarting an arena over storage whose packets are still linked:
//!
//! ```compile_fail,E0499
//! # use psx_gpu::{frame::PrimitiveArena, ot::OrderingTable, prim::TriFlat};
//! # fn f(dma: &mut psx_io::periph::GpuDma) {
//! let mut ot = OrderingTable::<8>::new();
//! let mut storage: [TriFlat; 4] = core::array::from_fn(|_| TriFlat::new([(0, 0); 3], 0, 0, 0));
//! let mut frame = ot.frame();
//! let mut arena = PrimitiveArena::new(&mut storage);
//! frame.add(1, arena.push(TriFlat::new([(0, 0), (8, 0), (0, 8)], 255, 0, 0)).unwrap());
//! let mut again = PrimitiveArena::new(&mut storage); // still borrowed by the frame
//! again.push(TriFlat::new([(0, 0); 3], 0, 0, 0));
//! frame.submit(dma);
//! # }
//! ```
