//! The raw linked-list layer: DMA channel 2 walking a chain of GP0 nodes.
//!
//! Each node is a tag word, the next node's address in bits 23..=0
//! ([`LIST_END`] ends the list) and the payload word count in bits 31..=24,
//! followed by that many GP0 words. The DMA controller follows the links on
//! its own, so whatever a tag names is read with no regard for Rust's
//! borrows: that is why [`submit_raw`] and [`submit_async_raw`] are
//! `unsafe`. The safe layers above them prove their contract instead:
//! [`crate::frame`] with lifetimes, [`StaticChain`] with `'static`
//! immutability, and [`crate::ordered`] with `'static` storage it owns.
//!
//! Every wait here is bounded. A walk that outlives its budget is aborted
//! and the GPU's half-read command discarded, so a wedged channel costs a
//! reset instead of a hang; [`crate::recovery_stats`] counts the aborts.
