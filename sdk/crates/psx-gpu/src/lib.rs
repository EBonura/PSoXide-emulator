//! The PS1 GPU: a driver that owns it, the packets it draws, and safe
//! frame building over its linked-list DMA.
//!
//! # Layers
//!
//! - [`Gpu`] owns GP0, GP1 and DMA channel 2 through the
//!   [`GpuDma`](psx_io::periph::GpuDma) token. Every port write is a method,
//!   so the borrow checker keeps immediate drawing out of a running walk.
//! - [`prim`] holds the packets: `repr(C)` structs whose words are the GP0
//!   wire format. [`Gpu::draw`] sends one now; an [`ot::OrderingTable`]
//!   frame links many for one DMA walk.
//! - [`frame`] builds frames with lifetimes instead of `unsafe`: a packet
//!   added to an [`frame::OtFrame`] stays borrowed until the walk that reads
//!   it has finished.
//! - [`ordered`] streams packets in painter order over static storage.
//! - [`display`] describes what the GPU shows; [`material`] describes how
//!   textured packets sample and blend.
//! - The raw layer, [`chain::submit_async_raw`] and the `*_unchecked`
//!   adds on [`frame::OtFrame`], is `unsafe`: it hands the DMA controller
//!   addresses the type system cannot follow.
//!
//! Register addresses and command-word encoders live in `psx-hw`, shared
//! with the emulator's GPU, so the two cannot disagree on a layout.
