//! GTE function-op wrappers.
//!
//! Each op corresponds to one COP2 cofun instruction. The constants
//! below are the exact 32-bit encodings PSX-SPX documents -- the same
//! bits the MIPS CPU would dispatch on hardware and the same bits the
//! emulator's `Gte::execute` decodes. On host we hand them straight
//! to the per-thread software GTE in [`crate::host`]; on MIPS we emit
//! them as `.word` instructions so LLVM's integrated assembler can't
//! reject the COP2 mnemonics it doesn't recognise.
//!
//! Encoding (per PSX-SPX, "GTE Coprocessor Opcodes"):
//!
//! ```text
//!   bits 31..26 = 0x12 (010010)      -- COP2
//!   bit  25     = 1                   -- `cop2 cofun` prefix
//!   bit  19     = sf                  -- fraction-shift
//!   bits 18..17 = mx                  -- MVMVA matrix select
//!   bits 16..15 = vx                  -- MVMVA vector select
//!   bits 14..13 = cv                  -- MVMVA translation select
//!   bit  10     = lm                  -- IR lower-bound mode
//!   bits 5..0   = opcode              -- function id
//! ```
//!
//! The `0x4A000000` base (`0x12<<26 | 1<<25`) is common to every op.
