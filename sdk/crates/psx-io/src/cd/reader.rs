//! Polled CD-ROM data-sector reads: seek, stream and pop 2048-byte sectors.
//!
//! [`SectorReader`] holds the [`Cd`] token and drives the controller through
//! its register steps, so the register map, the IRQ acknowledge order and the
//! BCD arithmetic exist once, in [`super`]. What it adds is the command
//! sequence the pack loader and the FMV streamer have run on silicon: a
//! SetMode-then-Setloc-then-ReadN start with every IRQ masked and every FIFO
//! in a known state, a wait loop that drains stale responses (and a stale
//! data sector into a bounce buffer) before it acknowledges them, and a Pause
//! that leaves the drive spun up. The comments that record silicon findings
//! travel with the code.
//!
//! Sectors come out of the data FIFO by CPU reads (PIO), not DMA channel 3.
//! The CL1/CL2 silicon probes convicted the chopping-burst DMA path on real
//! hardware: the transfer is a state-dependent lottery, and the channel can
//! latch its start bit and stay busy forever while moving nothing, which read
//! as all-zero sectors. PIO is the recipe the same probes proved byte-perfect:
//! arm the data request, wait until the FIFO reports data, pop all 2048 bytes.
//! It costs about 1.3 ms more per sector than a working DMA, and it cannot
//! wedge the DMA controller.
//!
//! # What `prepare` does to the machine
//!
//! [`SectorReader::prepare`] polls the controller's own IRQ flags, so it
//! keeps CD-ROM interrupts away from the CPU for the length of a stream:
//!
//! * `I_MASK` is set to VBlank-only (by `prepare`, and again by each
//!   `start_read`) until [`SectorReader::stop`] puts the previous value back. Every other source stops reaching the CPU in
//!   between: a CD-ROM IRQ with no handler would otherwise be an unhandled-IRQ
//!   storm.
//! * The latched CD-ROM `I_STAT` bit is acked and the controller's five IRQ
//!   enables are switched on, then every pending controller IRQ is acked.
//! * On the first `prepare` of a reader, IRQs latched by earlier activity (the
//!   BIOS disc boot's file load) are drained. Pausing instead would hang on
//!   an emulator that has no active read to pause.
//! * `SetMode` is sent: double speed and 2048-byte user data by default.
//!
//! No DMA channel is enabled: nothing here uses one.
