//! XA-ADPCM music: stream one channel of an interleaved XA file through the
//! drive's own decoder to the SPU's CD input.
//!
//! The encoder side is `psx-audio-cook xa-encode`; `docs/XA-MUSIC.md` has the
//! workflow. A song file holds several songs as interleaved channels (every
//! fourth sector for four 37.8 kHz stereo songs at single speed). With
//! XA-ADPCM and the file/channel filter switched on, the drive hands the
//! sectors of the chosen channel to its decoder and drops the rest; the CPU
//! never sees the audio.
//!
//! # The drive is busy while music plays
//!
//! Music is a read: the drive streams the file continuously, so the CPU
//! cannot read data from the disc meanwhile, not even at the same time at the
//! same speed (the laser follows the file, not the data). Load first, then
//! start the song, or stop it for the load and start it again afterwards (it
//! restarts from the top). Streaming data and music together needs the data
//! interleaved into the filler slots of the song file, which this player does
//! not do.
//!
//! # Polling
//!
//! The player is poll-driven like [`super::audio`]: call [`Player::poll`]
//! about once per frame. It asks the drive where the head is, and when the
//! head reaches the end of the song file it either restarts the file
//! (looping) or pauses the drive. A restart is a seek, so a loop has an
//! audible gap whose length is the drive's seek time; authoring the loop
//! point into a quiet passage hides it.
