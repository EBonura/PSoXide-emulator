//! CD-ROM drive: commands, responses, sector polling, CD-DA playback in
//! [`audio`], XA-ADPCM music in [`xa`] and polled data-sector reads in
//! [`reader`].
//!
//! One driver owns the controller: the [`Cd`] token. Every command and
//! register step is a method taking `&mut Cd`, so the borrow checker sees a
//! second driver that tries to program the controller while one is mid-command.
//! [`xa::Player`] and [`reader::SectorReader`] hold the token while they exist
//! and give it back with `release`.
//!
//! The controller exposes four byte registers selected by the low two
//! bits of the index register at [`psx_hw::cd::reg::INDEX`]. Register addresses, command bytes
//! and status bits live in [`psx_hw::cd`].
