//! PS1 memory map.
//!
//! The MIPS R3000A's 4 GiB virtual address space is divided into four
//! segments. On PS1, three of them mirror the same 512 MiB physical
//! address space; only the cache hint changes.
//!
//! | Segment | Virtual range              | Cached | Physical mapping |
//! |---------|----------------------------|--------|------------------|
//! | KUSEG   | `0x0000_0000..0x8000_0000` | yes    | `v & 0x1FFF_FFFF`|
//! | KSEG0   | `0x8000_0000..0xA000_0000` | yes    | `v & 0x1FFF_FFFF`|
//! | KSEG1   | `0xA000_0000..0xC000_0000` | no     | `v & 0x1FFF_FFFF`|
//! | KSEG2   | `0xC000_0000..0xFFFF_FFFF` | n/a    | cache control only |
//!
